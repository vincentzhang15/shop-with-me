## About "Shop With Me"

"Shop With Me" is a web application that futurizes, gamifies, and simplifies the process of in-store grocery shopping through three features:

"Find it" - Guides a user to a good (e.g., food item) with virtual arrows in a physical retail space.
"Ask me" - Filters a list of food items by nutrients according to a user's verbal inquiry.
"Show me" - Filters a list of related products in the grocery store according to a product image captured from a device camera.

It was built at Hack The Valley V in less than 38 hours.
